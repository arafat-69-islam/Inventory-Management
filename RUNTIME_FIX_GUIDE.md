# .NET Runtime Fix Guide

## Current Issue
The .NET 8.0 runtime is corrupted with a missing/corrupted `hostpolicy.dll` file, preventing any builds or testing.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Reinstall .NET SDK
1. Download the .NET 8.0 SDK from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0
2. Run the installer and choose "Repair" option if available
3. If repair doesn't work, uninstall completely and reinstall fresh

### 2. Verify Installation
After reinstalling, verify with these commands:
```bash
dotnet --info
dotnet --list-sdks
dotnet --list-runtimes
```

### 3. Clean and Restore Project
```bash
dotnet clean
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### 4. Test Basic Functionality
```bash
dotnet run
```

## Testing Plan After Runtime Fix

Once the runtime is fixed, we can proceed with comprehensive testing:

### Immediate Testing (Critical Path)
1. **Build Verification** - Ensure project compiles without errors
2. **Database Connectivity** - Test EF Core migrations and database access
3. **Basic Authentication** - Test user registration/login

### Comprehensive Testing Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [ ] Authentication flows
- [ ] Inventory CRUD operations
- [ ] Item management with custom fields
- [ ] Custom ID generation

#### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] File uploads to Cloudinary
- [ ] Admin functionality
- [ ] Access control enforcement
- [ ] Full-text search

#### Phase 3: UI/UX Validation
- [ ] Responsive design testing
- [ ] Accessibility compliance
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Testing Tools & Methods

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
dotnet test

# Integration tests
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration"

# Load testing
dotnet test --filter "Category=Performance"
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test all controller endpoints
- [ ] Verify database constraints
- [ ] Test file upload/download
- [ ] Validate UI interactions
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling

## Expected Timeline After Fix
- **Runtime Fix**: 1-2 hours
- **Initial Testing**: 2-3 hours
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 1-2 days

## Contact Support if Issues Persist
If the runtime issue persists after reinstallation, contact:
- .NET Support: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support
- System administrator for OS-level file corruption issues

The project implementation is complete and ready for testing once the runtime environment is restored.
